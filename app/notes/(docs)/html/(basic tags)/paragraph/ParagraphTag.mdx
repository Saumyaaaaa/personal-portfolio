import CodePreview from "@/components/Notes/CodePreview";
import { paragraphCode } from "./Code";

## Defining

The `<p>` tag is used to format text into distinct paragraphs. Each paragraph element is separated by automatic empty line spaces above and below the content, providing a clear visual separation. The tag must be closed with its corresponding `</p> `tag.

<CodePreview code={paragraphCode} file="index.html" />

## Best Practices

It's advisable to use the `<p>`tag for textual content and not for layout control. For layout purposes, consider using HTML5 semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, or CSS techniques.
