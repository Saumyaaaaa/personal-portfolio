## What Are HTML Entities?

HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

## Common HTML Entities

<pre> 
`&lt; for <`
`&gt; for >`
`&amp; for &`
`&nbsp; for a non-breaking space`
`&copy; for Â©`
</pre>

## How to Use HTML Entities

Entities can be implemented easily within HTML code. Here are some examples:

## Using Reserved Characters

<Code className="bg-[#171815] p-3 mt-2 text-slate-200">{`<p>The price is 10 &lt; 20.</p>`}</Code>

## Displaying Special Symbols

<Code className="bg-[#171815] p-3 mt-2 text-slate-200">{`<p>Copyright &copy; 2023.</p>`}</Code>

## Conclusion

HTML entities are essential for rendering special or reserved characters on a web page. Understanding how to use them effectively is key to creating web pages that display content as intended.
