## Types of HTML Lists

HTML provides two main types of lists: ordered lists (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`). Within these lists, individual items are defined using the list item tag (`<li>`). Here's an example of each:

-   Unordered List: Displays items using bullets.
-   Ordered List: Displays items in a numerical sequence, and supports various numbering styles.

## An Unordered List

An unordered list uses bullets to display items. It is suitable for listing items where the order doesn't matter. We will soon explore unordered lists in great detail

## An Ordered List

An ordered list uses numbers or other types of markers to indicate the sequence of items. It's ideal for listing steps in a process or ranking items in order of importance. We will soon explore ordered lists in great detail
