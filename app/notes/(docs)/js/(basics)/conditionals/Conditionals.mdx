import CodePreview from "@/components/Notes/CodePreview";
import { conditionalsCode } from "./Code";

It helps to determine the program flow using if or else statements. JavaScript has several conditional statements, including if, else if, and else. For example:

<CodePreview code={conditionalsCode} />

The condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false. If
the condition is true, the code in the "if" block is executed. If the condition is
false, the code in the "else" block is executed (if present).
