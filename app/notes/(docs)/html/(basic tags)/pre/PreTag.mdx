## When to Use the `<pre>` Tag?

The `<pre>`tag is most effective when you want the text to display on your HTML page exactly as it was typed, without any formatting changes. It is especially useful for displaying code snippets or preformatted text from data files.

## For Example

<CodePreview code={exampleCode} file="index.html" />

## Output

A simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"

def main():
print("Hello, World!")

if **name** == "**main**":
main()
