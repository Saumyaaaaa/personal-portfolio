## Basic Syntax

This is how the syntax to embed an image in html looks like:

<CodePreview code={ImageCode} file="index.html" />

## Setting Mandatory Attributes

The "src" and "alt" attributes are essential for the proper functioning of the `<img>` tag.

-   src attribute: Specifies the path to the image file.
-   alt attribute: Provides a text description for the image.

<CodePreview code={attrCode} file="index.html" />

## Setting Image Dimensions

Although dimensions can be set using the "width" and "height" attributes in the `<img>` tag, modern best practices recommend using CSS for this purpose.

<CodePreview code={dimCode} file="index.html" />

Setting the width and height attributes for images in HTML can have a positive impact on Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Specifying these dimensions in the `<img>` tag allows browsers to allocate the correct amount of space on a web page even before the image is fully loaded. This prevents layout shifts, improving the Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) scoreâ€”a key metric in Google's Core Web Vitals. A better CLS score can lead to a higher page ranking in search engine results.
