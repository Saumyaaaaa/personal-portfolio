## Js in Web Dev

JavaScript is commonly used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle events, and add functionality to websites. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create modern, interactive web applications.

In addition to its client-side use in web browsers, JavaScript is also employed on the server side, thanks to platforms like Node.js, enabling developers to use the same language for both front-end and back-end development.

## Getting Started with JavaScript

To start using JavaScript, you'll need a text editor and a web browser. There are many text editors available, such as Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, which are all popular choices among developers.

Once you have a text editor set up, you can start writing JavaScript code. To do this, you'll need to create a new file with a .js extension and then type your code into the file. You can then save the file and open it in your web browser to see the results.

## Node.js Installation

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is commonly used for building server-side applications, command-line tools, and other types of scalable network programs.

To install Node.js, you can follow these steps:

-   Download the installer: Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and click the "Download" button to download the latest version of the Node.js installer.

-   Run the installer: Double-click the downloaded installer file to start the installation process. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

-   Verify the installation: To verify that Node.js has been installed successfully, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

## Script using Node.js

To run JavaScript with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will need to follow these steps:

-   Install VS Code: If you don't already have it, you can download and install VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

-   Create a new JavaScript file: Open VS Code and create a new file with a .js extension. You can do this by going to File > New File or by using the shortcut Ctrl + N.

-   Write your JavaScript code: Type your JavaScript code into the file and save it.

-   Open the Command Palette: You can open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P or by going to View > Command Palette.

-   Run the JavaScript file: In the Command Palette, type "Run JavaScript" and select "Run JavaScript file in the terminal" from the list of options. This will open a terminal window and run your JavaScript file.

-   View the output: The output of your JavaScript code will be displayed in the terminal window.

Alternatively, you can also run JavaScript code directly in the terminal by using a command-line interpreter such as Node.js. To do this, you will need to install Node.js and then run your JavaScript file using the "node" command, followed by the name of the file.

## What is ECMAScript?

ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!

It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.
