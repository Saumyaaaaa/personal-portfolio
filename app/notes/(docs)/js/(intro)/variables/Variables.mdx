There are a few different ways to declare variables in JavaScript, each with its own syntax and rules. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the different types of variables available in JavaScript and how to use them.

## Variable Declaration

To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the **"var"** , **"let"** or **"const"** keyword followed by the name of the variable. For example:

<CodePreview code={variableCode} />

## Data types

JavaScript has several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined. You can use the typeof operator to check the data type of a variable. For example:

<CodePreview code={dataCode} />
