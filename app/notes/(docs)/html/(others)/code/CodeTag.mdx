## What is the `<code>`Tag?

The `<code>` tag is a semantic HTML tag `that's` used for displaying code snippets. It can be used both inline and within a block-level element like `<pre>`.

## Syntax

The most straightforward way to use the `<code>`tag is inline for short code snippets:

<CodePreview code={codeTag} />

## Using `<code>` with `<pre>`

For multiline code snippets, `it's` common to combine the `<code>` tag with the `<pre>` tag

<CodePreview code={preTagCode} />

## Conclusion

The `<code>` tag is commonly used to display inline code snippets or short lines of code within text content. If you have a larger block of code, you might want to use the `<pre>` (preformatted text) tag in combination with `<code>` for better formatting.
