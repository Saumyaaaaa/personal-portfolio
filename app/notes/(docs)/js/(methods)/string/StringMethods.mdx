JavaScript provides a number of built-in methods for manipulating strings. Some of the most commonly used string methods are:

### length

This method returns the number of characters in a string. For example, the following code will return 11:

<CodePreview code={stringCode} />

### concat

This method is used to concatenate (combine) two or more strings. For example, the following code will return "Hello World":

<CodePreview code={concatCode} />

### slice

This method is used to extract a portion of a string. For example, the following code will return "World":

### replace

This method is used to replace a specific character or substring in a string. For example, the following code will return "Hello Universe":

<CodePreview code={replaceCode} />

### toUpperCase and toLowerCase

These methods are used to convert a string to uppercase or lowercase letters. For example, the following code will return "HELLO WORLD" and "hello world" respectively:

<CodePreview code={caseCode} />

These are just a few of the many string methods available in JavaScript. By understanding the basics of strings and the various methods that can be used to manipulate them, you can create more dynamic and interactive web pages. So, start experimenting with different string methods and see what you can create!
