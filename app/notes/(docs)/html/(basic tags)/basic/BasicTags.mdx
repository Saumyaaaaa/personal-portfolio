## Document Structure:

The `<html>` tag serves as the root element of an HTML document, encapsulating the entire content. Inside it, the `<head>` tag contains meta-information about the document, and the `<title>` tag sets the title displayed in the browser's title bar or tab. The actual content of the webpage resides within the `<body>` tag.

## Text Formatting:

To structure text, the `<p>` tag defines paragraphs, while heading tags `<h1>` to `<h6>` represent headings of different levels. The `<strong>` or `<b>` tags are used for bold text, and `<em>` or `<i>` tags for italicizing. For underlining text, the` <u>` tag can be applied, although it's often recommended to use CSS for styling purposes.

## Lists:

HTML provides tags for creating lists: `<ul>` for unordered (bullet) lists, `<ol>` for ordered (numbered) lists, and `<li>` for individual list items.

## Links:

The `<a>` tag defines hyperlinks. It includes an href attribute, specifying the URL of the linked resource. This tag enables navigation between pages and websites.

## Images:

For embedding images, the `<img>` tag is used. It requires the src attribute, indicating the source URL of the image, and the alt attribute, providing alternative text for accessibility purposes.

## Tables:

Tables are created using the `<table>` tag, with `<tr> `defining rows, `<th>`for header cells, and`<td> `for data cells. The optional `<caption>` tag provides a title or caption for the table.

## Forms:

The `<form>` tag is employed to create HTML forms. Various input elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and `<button>` facilitate the collection and submission of user data.

## Semantic Markup:

Semantic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` are generic containers that help structure and style content. HTML5 introduces semantic tags such as `<header>`,` <footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` for more specific structuring of document sections, enhancing the clarity and meaning of the content.
