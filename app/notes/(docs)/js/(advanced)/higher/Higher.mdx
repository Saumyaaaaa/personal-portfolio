	**Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions by
	taking them as arguments or returning them.**
</i>

This concept is closely tied to the idea of functions as first-class citizens in the language. Higher-order functions enable powerful and flexible programming paradigms like functional programming. Here are some common higher-order functions in JavaScript:

<CodePreview code={higherCode} file="script.js" />

Here , in this code , **add** is an example of call back function and **calculate()** is an example of higher order function.
