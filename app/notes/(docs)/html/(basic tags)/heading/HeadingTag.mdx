## Things to know

-   In HTML, heading tags ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>` are used to define the structure and layout of text on a web page. These tags help create a hierarchical organization of content, making it easier for both users and search engines to understand the page's content.

-   The `<h1>` tag is generally used for the main title and is the largest and most prominent, while `<h2> `to `<h6>` tags are used for subheadings, further subheadings and so on... Proper use of heading tags not only improves the readability of a web page but also optimizes it for search engine ranking in Google

For Example :

<CodePreview code={headingCode} file="index.html" />

This structure helps organize the content hierarchically, making it clear and semantically meaningful. Adjust the content and structure according to your specific needs.

## Conclusion

It's important to use heading tags appropriately and in a semantically meaningful way to enhance the accessibility and usability of web content.
